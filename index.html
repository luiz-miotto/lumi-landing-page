   <p>It happened an age ago.
    But when I recall, I see it true.
    
    On a night of wint'ry fog.
    
    The rune of death was stolen
    And the demigods began to fall, starting with Godwyn the Golden.
    Queen Marika was driven to the brink.
    
    The Shattering ensued; a war that wrought only darkness.
    
    The Elden Ring was broken, but by whom? And why?
    What could the Demigods ever hope to win by warring?
    
    The conqueror of the stars, General Radahn.
    And the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed.
    
    These two were the mightiest to remain, and locked horns in combat.
    But there would be no victor.
    
    And so, we inhabit a fractured world.
    Awaiting the arrival of the Elden Lord.
    
    Unless of course, thou shouldst take the crown?</p>
